    - The PriorityList class treated "q=0" as if it was "q=1". RFC 2616 makes
      it clear that "0" is fine. (Dave Rolsky)

    - Language and character set negotiation now canonicalize all values. This
      means that if you say you provide "UTF-8" and a client requests "utf8"
      it will just work. (Dave Rolsky)
    - There are two new classes, HTTP::Headers::ActionPackage::AcceptCharset
      and AcceptLanguage. (Dave Rolsky)
    - If an Accept-Charset header does not contain "*" or "ISO-8859-1", then
      "ISO-8859-1" is given a priority of 1.0, per RFC-2616. (Dave Rolsky)
    - Content negotiation will never return any item explicitly forbidden
      ("q=0.0") in the headers, even if the header says it accepts "*" or that
      item is specified as a default in your code. (Dave Rolsky)
    - The HTTP::Headers::ActionPack->inflate method now works with
      Web::Request object. (Jesse Luehrs)
    - Fix tests that were broken in the absence of
      HTTP::Message::PSGI. (Florian Ragwitz)

    - fixed the HTTP::Message::PSGI errors
    - when you inflate a header object that has already 
      been inflated, ignore that header and keep looping
        - thanks to Florian Ragwitz for spoting this
